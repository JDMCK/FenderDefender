            <p>
                Fender Defender was created by a team of first-year Computer Systems
                Technology students at the British Columbia Institute of Technology
                in Burnaby, B.C. As a part of our journey towards learning good software
                principals, we developed Fender Defender as a tool to cut down on the
                effect weather has on your road safety. Our goal is to provide
                a system to ensure you can feel as comfortable as possible about the
                safety of your upcoming drive!

                We are looking to take the ambiguity out of your safety, how? Simple!
                We take in your some of your car's information: what type of vehicle you drive,
                the kind of tires you have on, the weather conditions, and your
                overall comfort of driving in certain conditions. We put it all
                together, calculate the overall risk factor and provide a suggestion
                on how safe it is for you to get there.
