            <p>
                Fender Defender was created by a team of first-year Computer Systems
                Technology students at the British Columbia Institute of Technology
                in Burnaby, B.C. As a part of our journey towards learning good software
                principals, we developed Fender Defender as a tool to cut down on the
                effect weather has on your road safety. Our goal is to provide
                a system to ensure you can feel as comfortable as possible about the
                safety of your upcoming drive!
